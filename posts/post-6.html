      <h2>AI practice prompt</h2>
      <pre>
Be a hiring manager for [Role]. Ask me 8 behavioral questions, one at a time.
After each answer, give:
- 2 strengths you heard
- 2 things to tighten (be specific)
- A stronger STAR rewrite in 3–4 lines
Then ask the next question.
      </pre>

      <p>Practice out loud, record yourself, and refine with feedback. Repetition = confidence.</p>
